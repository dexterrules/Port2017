Change the variables in intitial-variables.sass
Use Koala to export bulma.sass (compile) A bulma.css file will be created.
Link this bulma file to the html doc. 
Note: there is also one more css file inside css/bulma.css Don't use this one.
Just change the variable value in the sub folders of sass files, but compile ONLY bulma.sass 

If others are compiled, it gives an error message. Ignore that message.
